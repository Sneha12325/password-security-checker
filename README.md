    *   Numbers (0-9)
    *   Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %)
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Offers clear and actionable suggestions for improving password strength.
*   **Easy to Use:** A straightforward command-line interface for quick checks.

## üöÄ How to Run

To run this password checker on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Python is Installed:**
    *   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Download the Script:**
    *   You can clone the entire repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Sneha12325/password-security-checker.git
        cd password-security-checker
        ```
    *   Alternatively, simply download the `password_checker.py` file directly.

3.  **Navigate to the Script Directory:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved `password_checker.py`.
        *   **Example (Windows):** `cd C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads`
        *   **Example (macOS/Linux):** `cd ~/Documents/Projects/password-security-checker`

4.  **Execute the Script:**
    *   Run the script using the Python interpreter:
        ```bash
        python password_checker.py
        ```
        (You might need to use `python3 password_checker.py` on some systems.)
